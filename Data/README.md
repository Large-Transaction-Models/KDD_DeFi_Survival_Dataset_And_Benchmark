# Data for the Data Analytics Research DeFi project.

This directory primarily contains data that we intend to include in a public-facing github repository for publication alongside our Survival Analysis benchmarking paper. 
This include three subdirectories containing different kinds of data.

1. Survival_Data: The survival data folder contains the bulk of the data, and the most important data for the paper. This is the actual survival data created by the processes outlined in the paper and used in the experiments.

2. Raw_Transaction_Data_Sample: This folder contains a small sample of the raw transaction data that is used to create the large set of survival data. We only provide a sample of the data for two reasons. First, the full transaction data is much too large to be included in a github repository. Second, we want to keep the raw transaction data private for use in further research.

3. Other_Data: The other data includes any other small dataframes that can be helpful for feature-engineering the survival data.

Other data that will be used for this project will be accessed directly on the IDEA cluster and will be specified in sample notebooks, as well as discussed in class.
